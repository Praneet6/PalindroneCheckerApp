📘 Palindrome Checker App
UC5: Stack-Based Palindrome Validation
📌 Project Overview

The PalindromeChecker App is a console-based Java application designed to validate whether a given string is a palindrome using a Stack data structure.

This use case (UC5) demonstrates how stack operations naturally reverse character order, making palindrome validation efficient and educational.

🎯 Objective

Implement palindrome validation using a stack

Strengthen understanding of LIFO principle

Practice push & pop operations

Apply data structure concepts to real problemsgit log
