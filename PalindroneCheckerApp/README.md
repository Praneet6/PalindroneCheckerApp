Palindrome Checker App
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC9: Recursive Palindrome Checker
Goal: Check palindrome using recursion.
Flow:
Recursive call compares start & end
Base condition exits recursion
Key Concepts used in UC9:
Recursion – A technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.
Base Condition – Prevents infinite recursion and terminates the recursive calls.
Call Stack – Memory structure used to manage method calls during recursion.
Data Structure: Call Stack
