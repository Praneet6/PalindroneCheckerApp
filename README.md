Palindrome Checker App
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC7: Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Checker
Goal: Use Deque to compare front and rear elements.
Flow:
Insert characters into deque
Remove first & last
Compare until empty
Key Concepts used in UC7:
Deque (Double Ended Queue) – A data structure that allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear ends.
Front and Rear Access – Enables direct comparison of first and last characters.
Optimized Data Handling – Eliminates the need for separate reversal data structures.
Data Structure: Deque
