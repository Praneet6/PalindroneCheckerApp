Palindrome Checker App
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

UC6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check
Goal: Demonstrate FIFO vs LIFO using Queue and Stack.
Flow:
Enqueue characters
Push characters to stack
Compare dequeue vs pop
Key Concepts used in UC6:
Queue – A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Enqueue & Dequeue Operations – Used to insert and remove elements from the queue.
Stack vs Queue – Demonstrates the behavioral difference between LIFO and FIFO structures.
Logical Comparison – Matching dequeue (queue) output with pop (stack) output to validate palindrome logic.
Data Structures: Queue, Stack
