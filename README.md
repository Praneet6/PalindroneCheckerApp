UC4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check
Goal: Convert string to character array and compare characters.
Flow:
Convert string to char[]
Use two-pointer approach
Compare start & end characters
Key Concepts used in UC4:
Character Array (char[]) – A primitive array used to store individual characters of a string for index-based access.
Array Indexing – Accessing elements using index positions starting from 0.
Two-Pointer Technique – One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end, reducing unnecessary comparisons.
Time Complexity Awareness – Demonstrates efficient comparison without creating extra objects.
Data Structure: char[]
