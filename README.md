09 UC8 - Linked List Based Palindrome Checker

Goal:
Check palindrome using singly linked list.

Flow:
Convert string to linked list
Reverse second half
Compare halves
Key Concepts:
Singly Linked List – A dynamic data structure where elements are connected using node references.
Node Traversal – Sequential access to elements using next references.
Fast and Slow Pointer Technique – Used to find the middle of the linked list efficiently.
In-Place Reversal – Reverses the second half of the list without extra memory.
